This is a (WIP) analysis of publicly available data on Covid-19, particularly for my own interest.  Very much WIP, initial commit is to backup but much is being changed locally on a daily basis.

TO DO:
1. Separate functions out into independent files.

2. Generalize to just input <COUNTRY,STATE,COUNTY> and output plot.

3. Automatically look for `anomalies'---i.e. locations where data indicates a high growth rate or an increase in positive tests wrt total tests.

4. Copy data to repo?
